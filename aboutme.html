        <p>My name is Julia and I've been living near Atlanta for about 11 years now. I was born in Florida and before that, my
            parents immigrated here from Brazil and before that, their parents immigrated there from Japan.</p>
        <p>I chose computational media as my major because I love games. I grew up playing Mario Kart with my cousins on the SNES,
            DS, and Wii. I would watch my father play God of War III and Final Fantasy Type-0. I competed against my sisters
            in party games like Mario Party or Pac-Man Fever. And I was able to stay connected with friends and even make new
            ones through online multiplayer games like Minecraft, Valorant, and League of Legends.</p>
        <p>I like to belive my heritage contributed to and continues to fuel my passions. After all, some of my first memories of
            gaming includes watching my eldest cousin play platformers on my grandfather's console, which, at the time, was expensive
            to import to Brazil. And it's interesting to witness the culture of gaming in Japan as it continues to be one of the
            biggest gaming industries in the world even today. Though Brazil isn't necessarily known for its video games, its
            growing esports scene is exciting to watch. Though CSGO, I believe, is the most popular at the moment, I'm more
            interested in Valorant.</p>
